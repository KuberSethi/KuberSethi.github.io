					Hi! I'm Kuber Sethi, a Junior at Rutgers University New Brunswick.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					I've been programming in some form for around 6 years now. I started with making simple mods and scripts for games like The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, and Arma 3. I then began experimenting with web development. Once I hit high school and was able to take computer science classes, I began my journey into the world of traditional Object-Oriented Programming. Previously, I had played around with C++ to get mods working, but never had any formal experience, or understanding. After learning Java in school, I began learning Python myself online. Currently I plan on learning more Python, and more advanced web development tools. Feel Free to connect with me via Social Media, I would love talking about programming as well as anything else. 
				</p>

				<p>
					I strongly believe that everyone should engage in a lifelong pursuit of knowledge, regardless of what knowledge they desire. For me, I've lately been into history, philosophy, fashion, and music. If you share similar hobbies, get in touch! I would love to discuss them with someone from a similar background.
