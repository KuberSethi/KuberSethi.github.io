				<p>
					Hi! I'm Kuber Sethi, a Software Engineer living in New York City.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					I'm currently working at Yext, and in the past I've worked at startups like Forward as well as larger companies like AWS and Ancestry. Aside from work, I'm really passionate about working on side projects. I've recently been working on a video game store which rewards dedicated gamers via lower prices. I'm also working on an information management tool to help me organize my consumption of online articles and e-books.  
				</p>

				<p>
					I strongly believe that everyone should engage in a lifelong pursuit of knowledge, regardless of what knowledge they desire. For me, I've passionate about music (I dabble in production using Ableton, and DJing), history, and current events. If you share similar hobbies, get in touch! I would love to discuss them with someone from a similar background.
