					Hi! I'm Kuber Sethi, a junior at East Brunswick High School, NJ. I've been programming in some form for around 4 years now. I started with making simple mods and scripts for games like The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, and Arma 3. I then began experimenting with web development. Once I hit high school and was able to take computer science classes, I began my journey into the world of traditional Object-Oriented Programming. Previously, I had played around with C++ to get mods working, but never had any formal experience, or understanding. After learning Java in school, I began learning Python myself online. Currently I plan on learning more Python, and more advanced web development tools/frameworks like Node.js, Ruby on Rails, and more. Feel Free to connect with me via Social Media, I would love talking about programming as well as anything else. 
				</p>

					Outside of school and programming, my hobbies include (you can probably guess this one) gaming, listening to EDM music, playing the Flute, fashion, and politics. In terms of gaming, I'm currently having a lot of fun with Overwatch, Starcraft 2, Insurgency, Red Orchestra 2/ Rising Storm, Arma 3, and Skyrim. While junior year has gotten pretty tough, I still devote a probably unhealthy amount of time to gaming. For music, I'm an avid EDM fan, and have been for years. My top 3 artists at the moment would be (in this order): Porter Robinson, KSHMR, and Madeon, but I enjoy all subgenres from trap to deep house. Outside of EDM, I manage to listen to a little bit of everything, from rap/hip-hop like Logic and Drake to Classical/Jazz. I'm still in high school, so I unfortunately can't afford to purchase the latest hypebeast outfits, but I'm pretty into minimalism and palewave these days. Hit me up if you wanna talk about anything, I have a lot more free time than I probably should, and more friends can never hurt.
