				<p>
					Hi! I'm Kuber Sethi, a Rising Senior at Rutgers University New Brunswick.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					I'm currently interning at Amazon Web Services, and have also interned at Ancestry last summer. I'm heavily involved with the CS community at Rutgers. Last year, I was the President of Rutgers Fizzbuzz, one of the biggest CS organizations on campus, which is responsible for helping students with their careers. I was also the Hacker Ambassador for USACS, the main CS organization on campus, my sophomore year, where I helped organize inter-school hackathon relations. Aside from work and school, I'm really passionate about working on side projects. I've recently been having a lot of fun with Go, and am working on an information management tool to help me organize my consumption of information from online articles to my Kindle books.  
				</p>

				<p>
					I strongly believe that everyone should engage in a lifelong pursuit of knowledge, regardless of what knowledge they desire. For me, I've passionate about history, philosophy, current events, and music. If you share similar hobbies, get in touch! I would love to discuss them with someone from a similar background.
